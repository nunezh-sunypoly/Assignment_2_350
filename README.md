Assignment_2_350 Due on Oct 22, 2024 11:59 PM

Procedure for assignment 2
You proceed as follows. But, also refer to my class remarks. Remember that you are 
supposed to teach from one another, learn from one another, collaborate, etc.
Similar to the procedure for assignment 1, except that I grade only one file from each 
team.
1. As in assignment 1, one member of your team (and only one) creates a repository in 
 GitHub. The repository must be named
 Assignment_2_350
 Then,
(a) add README; modify this README, stating the purpose of this 
 assignment 
(b) invite the team members as collaborators, so that they will have push 
 access for the repository
(c) also make me (the instructor) a collaborator, for purposes of grading 
 the assignment; my user name on GitHub is
 manalym
(d) share the Git URL of the repository to everyone.
3. Now, for the actual homework, proceed using one or both the modes I stated in the
 procedure for project 1. So, do merge anything you have completed with the main 
 branch. I grade only the (only) homework file in the main branch.
4. After your team is done with the assignment, each team member must go to 
 Brightspace; under Assignments, in Assignment 2, submit a text file, or just write a 
 text as submission saying that you have submitted your assignment in GitHub (for 
 purposes of recording/grading in Brightspace).
